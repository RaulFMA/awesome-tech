The most successful deployments we hear about are implemented by large corporations like eBay, AT&T and PayPal.  These companies have the resources to deploy armies of programmers and talented sysadmins to understand, manage and curate the code, which seems to be the biggest consumer of effort for the project.

### AWS Latency
- [Find the fastest region from your location](http://aws-latency.altaircp.com/) Check AWS response time from you browser. Sharing my mini-project, it measures response time from AWS services from different regions base on your location. let me know what you think.
- [Linkedin Discussion](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/49531/49531-6092152919937794052)
>1. Don't do just a single check, the first check will be a lot slower as DNS lookups will need to be done, etc.
>2. I'd recommend doing at least 3 checks getting an average.
- Run 6 checks (with a random 3-10 second delay between each one), the first can be ignored, the highest one is also ignored (as a likely outlier), then for the next 4 show the minimum, maximum and average (mean).
