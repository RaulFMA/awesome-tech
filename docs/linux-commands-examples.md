# Linux Commands Examples
- [Linux Commands Tweets](linux-commands-tweets.md)
- [nixCraft: My 10 UNIX Command Line Mistakes](http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/my-10-unix-command-line-mistakes.html)

- Make your prompt safer with # so that if you accidentally copy & paste it, it doesn't run. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

		PS1="# $PS1"

- In bash, cd - takes you back to your previous directory.

- Tired of repeatedly pressing 'y' through some shell process? Try the 'yes' command: ðŸŒŸ

		yes | rm *.txt 
		yes | fsck /dev/FOO

- Edit a file on a remote server using vim from your local *nix desktop

		vim scp://user@server1//etc/httpd/httpd.conf 

- In vim this will search all lines (%s) for wlan0 and replace all the instances per line (g) with eth3 and confirm (c)

		:%s/wlan0/eth3/gc 
		
- Using +F option or pressing F in less is similar to `tail -f filename.log` but can use less's features. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

		less +F filename.log 

- Show the first and last 5 lines of the file 'log'.

		(head -5; tail -5) < log
		
- Make less more like more, but still more than more. Percent of file in prompt, etc. 

		export LESS='-sCmqPm--Less--(?eEND:%pb\%.)'

- This environment variable will invoke 'less' with these options when it is used. Like when viewing a man page.

		export LESS="-S -j10 -i" 

- Find out which of your directories(below the current directory) occupy at least 1GB of space. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

		du -h . | grep "^[0-9\.]\+G"

- List of empty subdirectories of current directory.

		find . -empty -type d

- Find and long list mp3 files in Music dir older than a year and larger than 10MB.

		find music -name '*.mp3' -mtime +365 -a -size +10M -ls 

- Like ping, but it uses an ARP request to check, which gets around host firewalls blocking ICMP. Only works on same subnet

		arping 10.0.8.5

- Show directory size and sort by human readable amount (MB, GB, etc.). Requires GNU sort for -h option. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

		du -sh */ | sort -h 

- Show the total space used on all your local disk partitions. ðŸŒŸ

		df -lP |awk '{sum += $3} END {printf "%d GiB\n", sum/2**20}' 

- Print disk space used on all ext3 or 4 FS in GiB.

		df -Pl -t ext3 -t ext4 | tail -n+2 | awk '{ sum+=$3 } END { print sum/2**20 }'

- Quickly remove duplicate lines from a log/text file on Unix/Linux system: 

		awk '!seen[$0]++' app.logfile

- Life is too short to run the same command twice.

		export HISTSIZE=0 

- Want to increments all numbers in input.txt? 

		perl -pe 's/(\d+)/ 1 + $1 /ge' input.txt

- cp - u will only copy files that don't exist, or are newer than their existing counterparts, in the destination directory.
- Print server serial/product/manufacturer:
		
		for i in serial-number manufacturer product-name; do 
		echo "$i $(dmidecode -s system-${i})"; 
		done

- Copy a file using "ionice -c 3" to give it idle priority to reduce load on the system.

		ionice -c 3 cp vm1.img vm1-clone.img

- Remove the prefix 'unwanted' from the beginning of each filename with .jpg suffix in CWD.

		rename 's/^unwanted//' *.jpg

- Find file duplicates in 'dir' recursively based on size and mdsum and log to dupes.txt

		fdupes -r dir > dupes.txt

- Quickly find the largest 5 files in the CWD tree without crossing filesystem boundaries ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

		find . -xdev -ls | sort -n -k 7 | tail -5

- counts files in the current path by modification month

		find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -printf '%TY-%Tm\n' | sort | uniq -c 

- Use the */ trick to get only the directories, then use ${dir%/} to remove the trailing / you get

		for dir in */ ; do echo "${dir%/}" ; done

- Move current year pics to 2015 directory.

		find . -maxdepth 1 -daystart -type f -name '*.jpg' -mtime -$( date +%j ) -exec mv -v {} 2015/ \;

- Lower case all files in a folder.

		for f in *; do b=$(echo "$f" | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'); mv "$f" "$b"; done

- Print the day of the year. Can be useful with things like find.

		date +%j 

- Make month histogram of dates of files in current directory.

		ls -la --full-time |tr -s " " |cut -f6 -d " "|cut -c1-7 | sort | uniq -c

		ssh -t user1@server1 'ssh -t user2@server2 "ssh -t user3@server3"'

- The awk variable $1 contains the first field in a record, $2 the second, $3 the third, etc. $0 contains all fields.

- Print all from 3rd field to end of line. Very useful for log parsing.

		lsof /|awk '{ if($7>1048576) print $7/1048576 "MB" " " $9 " " $1 }'|sort -nu|tail 

- *"Attempt"* to recover an accidentally removed file. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

		fgrep --binary-files=text -C 2000 "string in file" /dev/sda > recovereddata.out 

- Replace foo with bar only on lines that contain 'bang'. Use in pipeline or with file args. ðŸŒŸ

		sed "/bang/ s/foo/bar/" 

- Recursive search and replace old with new string, inside files. recursively traverse the directory structure from . down, look for string "oldstring" in all files, and replace it with "newstring", wherever found ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

		$ grep -rl oldstring . |xargs sed -i -e 's/oldstring/newstring/'

		also:
		
		grep -rl oldstring . |xargs perl -pi~ -e 's/oldstring/newstring'

- Watch web server access log for HTTP status code 500 & display entry generated that code: ðŸŒŸ

		tail -f access.log | awk '$9 == 500 { print $0 }'
